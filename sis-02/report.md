  This is the only file you write your report in. README.md tells you what goes where.

  Rules the checker relies on:
  - Do not delete, rename or renumber the ## headings, the ### headings, or the **Label:** words.
  - Replace every "(write here)" and "(paste here)". None may be left when you submit.
  - Comments like this one are ignored by the checker and the word counter. Delete them or leave them.

## 1. Scope and assumptions

<!-- Your FINAL scope statement and assumptions, after reviewing Prompt A's output. Say here
     what is out of scope (payments, prerequisites, timetable clashes, waiting lists,
     cancellation) — section 2 must not mention them. Section 10 keeps your first version. -->

**Scope:** This system allows a user to browse the movie schedule, check seat availability, and book a ticket for a specific showtime, while preventing double-booking of the same seat. Payments and food pre-orders are out of scope.

**Assumptions:**

1. The user is already logged into their cinema account.
2. The selected movie showtime exists in the database.

## 2. User stories and acceptance criteria

<!-- Your APPROVED requirements: Prompt A's draft after your review. Keep the IDs, the three
     story headings and the bullet shape. Every criterion names the rule(s) it maps to,
     e.g. (R2, R4). Two criteria per story. Nothing out of scope.
     Format of a criterion, on one bullet:
     - **AC-03** (R2, R4): Given ..., When ..., Then ... -->

### US-01 — Browse offerings

**US-01:** (write here — As a student, I want …, so that …)

- **AC-01** (R?): (write here — Given …, When …, Then …)
- **AC-02** (R?): (write here)

### US-02 — Register for an offering

**US-02:** (write here)

- **AC-03** (R?): (write here)
- **AC-04** (R?): (write here)

### US-03 — Receive a clear rejection

**US-03:** (write here)

- **AC-05** (R?): (write here)
- **AC-06** (R?): (write here)

## 3. Sequence diagram

<!-- The FINAL diagram, rendered. Change .png to .svg if that is what you exported. -->

![Final sequence diagram](models/img/sequence.png)

**Participants:** (write here — each lifeline and what it stands for)

**Atomic operation:** (write here — which messages form the one atomic step: the final duplicate check, the capacity check and the creation of the Enrollment, and why a catalog view reserves nothing)

**Where the Enrollment is created:** (write here — which message, which lifeline, and which class in section 4 it produces)

**Technical lifelines:** (write here — every lifeline that is NOT a class in the class diagram, by name, and why the difference in abstraction is fine. "None" if there are none.)

## 4. Class diagram

<!-- The FINAL diagram, rendered. -->

![Final class diagram](models/img/classes.png)

<!-- One row per association in classes.puml, read in both directions. -->

| Association | Read left to right | Read right to left |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

**How an Enrollment links a student to an offering:** (write here)

**Capacity constraint:** (write here — and why multiplicity alone cannot express it)

**Uniqueness constraint:** (write here — and why multiplicity alone cannot express it)

## 5. Traceability

<!-- Every rule, including the catalog fields and availability (R1). Column 1: the rule and
     the criteria that cover it, e.g. "R2 + AC-03, AC-04". Column 2: the message, guard,
     class or constraint that shows the rule in YOUR diagrams. Column 3: the T-ID that
     exercises it, or the extra check you did instead (R1 has no T case). -->

| Rule and criterion | Model evidence | Validation case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R2 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R3 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R4 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| R5 + (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

## 6. Walkthroughs

<!-- Walk each case through YOUR final sequence diagram, message by message. Column 2: the
     actual steps and the state change (count before → after). Column 3 starts with Pass or
     Fail, then the location: the message, guard or note where you saw it. A Fail you
     report honestly is a finding, not a penalty. -->

| Case | Observed path and state change | Judgment and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1. Available | (write here) | (write here) |
| T2. Last place | (write here) | (write here) |
| T3. Full | (write here) | (write here) |
| T4. Duplicate | (write here) | (write here) |

## 7. Review decisions

<!-- At least three substantive decisions about Prompt C's critique or your own inspection.
     Decision: accepted / rejected / modified — and what you did. Reason: why, in a full
     sentence. Rule: R1–R5. Do not invent an error to fill the table; a justified rejection
     of advice counts. -->

| AI suggestion or model element | Decision | Reason | Rule |

| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |
| (write here) | (write here) | (write here) | (write here) |

## 8. Modeling explanation

<!-- 200–300 words. Your main design choices; how the class diagram and the sequence diagram
     complement each other; why an activity diagram could also help explain the workflow. -->

(write here)

## 9. Reflection

<!-- 150–200 words. Written by you, not by the assistant: where AI helped, one decision you
     made yourself, one remaining limitation. Specific beats flattering. -->

(write here)

## 10. Appendix A — Before AI

<!-- Written BEFORE you run Prompt A, committed and pushed in your first commit, and never
     edited afterwards. This is what you paste into Prompt A as "My initial assumptions". -->

**Scope:** (write here)

**Initial assumptions:**

1. (write here)
2. (write here)

## 11. Appendix B — AI exchanges

<!-- Complete prompts and complete responses, as text — never screenshots. Paste each inside
     the ~~~~ block that follows its label: AI responses contain ``` PlantUML blocks, and
     ~~~~ keeps them from breaking this file. Prompts B and C: the prompt text first, then
     the material it refers to ("below", "these two") pasted under it, in the same block.
     You may add B5, B6 … after B4 if you ran more. -->

### B1 — Requirements (Prompt A)

- **Tool:** (write here)
- **Model:** (write here)
- **Date:** (write here)
- **Purpose:** draft 3 user stories and 6 acceptance criteria

<!-- Model: the exact model with its version, as the tool shows it (e.g. "GPT-5 Thinking",
     "Claude Sonnet 4.5"). If the tool does not show it, write: not displayed
     Date: YYYY-MM-DD -->

**Prompt:**

Act as a requirements analyst. Use only this course registration scenario and rules R1–R5: A student browses an electronic course catalog, chooses a course offering and requests registration. Each offering has a limited number of places. A Course describes a subject. A Course Offering is one scheduled section in one semester. Registration always targets a specific offering. Assume that the student is signed in, the selected offering exists, and its capacity is a positive whole number. R1. Catalog: Show the course code, title, offering and available places for one semester. R2. Capacity: Recheck current availability when registering. Enrollment must never exceed the offering's capacity. R3. Duplicates: A student may have at most one enrollment in the same offering. Reject a repeat request. R4. Success: Create exactly one Enrollment linking the student and offering, update availability and return a confirmation. R5. Rejection: Explain "course full" or "already enrolled". Create no enrollment and leave the enrollment count unchanged. A catalog view does not reserve a place. Model the final checks and enrollment creation as one atomic operation, so competing requests cannot take the same last place. A note describing it is enough. Out of scope: payments, prerequisites, timetable clashes, waiting lists, cancellation. Use fictional students and courses. Treat any extra AI suggestion as a proposal you accept or reject explicitly. My initial assumptions are: **Scope:** This system allows a user to browse the movie schedule, check seat availability, and book a ticket for a specific showtime, while preventing double-booking of the same seat. Payments and food pre-orders are out of scope.

**Assumptions:**

1. The user is already logged into their cinema account.
2. The selected movie showtime exists in the database..

Draft 3 user stories and 2 Given / When / Then acceptance criteria for each. Use IDs US-01 to US-03 and AC-01 to AC-06. Map each criterion to rule IDs.
Cover normal and rejection behavior. List uncertainty separately. Do not add excluded features or invent university policies.


**Response:**

US-01: Browse Course Catalog
As a student, I want to browse the electronic course catalog for a semester so that I can see the available subjects and how many places are left.

AC-01 [R1]: Given the student is viewing the catalog for a specific semester, When the page loads, Then the system shows the course code, title, offering, and available places.

AC-02 [Scenario, R5]: Given a student is viewing the catalog, When they see available places for an offering, Then the system does not reserve a place or change the enrollment count until a registration request is explicitly made.

US-02: Register for a Course Offering
As a student, I want to register for a specific course offering so that I can secure an available place in the class.

AC-03 [R2, R4]: Given the student is not currently enrolled in the selected offering and its current availability is greater than zero, When the student requests registration, Then the system creates exactly one Enrollment linking the student and offering, updates the available places, and returns a confirmation.

AC-04 [Scenario, R2]: Given a course offering has exactly one place remaining, When the student requests registration, Then the system executes the final availability check and enrollment creation as one atomic operation to ensure the capacity is never exceeded.

US-03: Registration Validation and Rejection
As a student, I want to receive clear feedback if my registration fails so that I know why I was not enrolled.

AC-05 [R2, R5]: Given the current availability of the selected course offering is zero, When the student requests registration, Then the system explains "course full", creates no enrollment, and leaves the enrollment count unchanged.

AC-06 [R3, R5]: Given the student already has an existing enrollment in the selected course offering, When the student requests registration for that same offering, Then the system explains "already enrolled", creates no enrollment, and leaves the enrollment count unchanged.

Uncertainty

UI Semester Selection: The scenario states the catalog shows offerings "for one semester," but it is uncertain if the student explicitly filters by semester or if the system defaults to the upcoming one.

Concurrent Read/Write Performance: While the final check and creation are atomic, it is uncertain how aggressively the catalog view should cache "available places" versus querying real-time data, potentially leading to a high rate of "course full" rejections during peak registration times.

Assumptions Conflict: The provided initial assumptions (Scope and Assumptions) referenced a cinema/movie schedule system. These were ignored to strictly adhere to the provided course registration scenario and rules R1-R5.

### B2 — UML drafts (Prompt B)

- **Tool:** (write here)
- **Model:** (write here)
- **Date:** (write here)
- **Purpose:** draft the sequence and class diagrams

**Prompt:**

Using my approved scenario, R1-R5, stories and criteria below, return separate PlantUML code blocks for a sequence diagram and a domain class diagram.

Sequence: include catalog browsing and guarded success, full-course and duplicate outcomes. Model final checks and creation as one atomic operation.

Class: show domain concepts, useful attributes and multiplicities. State the capacity and uniqueness constraints. Explain assumptions and any technical lifelines.

US-01: Browse Course Catalog
As a student, I want to browse the electronic course catalog for a semester so that I can see the available subjects and how many places are left.

AC-01 [R1]: Given the student is viewing the catalog for a specific semester, When the page loads, Then the system shows the course code, title, offering, and available places.

AC-02 [Scenario, R5]: Given a student is viewing the catalog, When they see available places for an offering, Then the system does not reserve a place or change the enrollment count until a registration request is explicitly made.

US-02: Register for a Course Offering
As a student, I want to register for a specific course offering so that I can secure an available place in the class.

AC-03 [R2, R4]: Given the student is not currently enrolled in the selected offering and its current availability is greater than zero, When the student requests registration, Then the system creates exactly one Enrollment linking the student and offering, updates the available places, and returns a confirmation.

AC-04 [Scenario, R2]: Given a course offering has exactly one place remaining, When the student requests registration, Then the system executes the final availability check and enrollment creation as one atomic operation to ensure the capacity is never exceeded.

US-03: Registration Validation and Rejection
As a student, I want to receive clear feedback if my registration fails so that I know why I was not enrolled.

AC-05 [R2, R5]: Given the current availability of the selected course offering is zero, When the student requests registration, Then the system explains "course full", creates no enrollment, and leaves the enrollment count unchanged.

AC-06 [R3, R5]: Given the student already has an existing enrollment in the selected course offering, When the student requests registration for that same offering, Then the system explains "already enrolled", creates no enrollment, and leaves the enrollment count unchanged.
